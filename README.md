# Dungeon Crawler Game

This project is a lightweight browser-based dungeon crawler. It lets players explore levels, battle enemies and gather loot directly in the browser.

## Playing

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser to start the game. The player now begins with every available skill already learned, so no class selection is required.


### Controls

- Use the arrow keys or on-screen arrows to move your character.
- Press `Z` (or `F`) or click **Attack** to strike the nearest monster.
- Number keys `1`-`9` open the details of each hired mercenary.
- Additional actions such as **Heal**, **Recall**, **Skill1** and **Skill2** are available via the action buttons. You can also use `X` for **Skill1**, `C` for **Skill2**, `V` for **Ranged** attack and `A` to recall your mercenaries.

### Hiring Mercenaries

Click the buttons in the *Hire Mercenary* panel to recruit warriors, archers, healers or wizards. Each mercenary costs gold and appears near the player. You may have up to five mercenaries at a time; when full you will be prompted to replace an existing ally.

### Shop and Skill System

Spend collected gold in the shop to purchase items. Bought gear is placed in your inventory and can boost your stats when equipped. All skills are unlocked from the start and can be assigned to the **Skill1** and **Skill2** slots.

### Mercenary Skills

Each mercenary receives one random skill upon hiring. Using that skill costs the
mercenary's mana, and the skill's name and icon show up in the combat log when
activated. You can see the assigned skill and its mana cost in the mercenary's
detail panel and in the side list by their portrait. Open a mercenary's detail
panel with the corresponding number key (`1`-`9`) or by clicking their portrait
in the UI.


### Mercenary Traits

*This system has been removed.* Mercenaries no longer receive random traits or related bonuses.

### Mercenary Affinity (호감도 시스템)

Mercenaries and revived monsters track an *affinity* value that measures their
loyalty to the party.

- Newly hired mercenaries start with **50** affinity.
- Revived monsters start with **30** affinity.
- Affinity rises slowly each turn a unit stays in your party and caps at **200**.
- When a mercenary dies they lose **5** affinity. If their affinity drops to zero
  they permanently leave your party.

You can view a unit's current affinity by opening their detail window. The value
appears near the top of the stats panel.

#### Food and Cooking

Food items increase affinity. Simple drops like **Bread** provide small bonuses
(+3 affinity), while cooked dishes from the **Crafting** tab grant larger
amounts. For example, combining Bread, Carrot and Milk into a **Sandwich** yields
**+15** affinity.

Ingredient items and cooking recipes drop randomly during exploration and are
stored as crafting materials rather than in your main inventory.

### Elite Monsters and Auras

Each dungeon floor now contains at least one **elite** monster. Elites boast higher stats and randomly receive an aura skill that benefits nearby allies. When an elite is revived as a mercenary, it keeps this aura skill. Elites appear with a purple glow and the "엘리트" prefix.

#### Superior Rank

Superior elites are a planned upgrade to normal elites. They carry two aura skills and gain strength through a star-based system. They are not yet part of the regular dungeon spawns.

### Incubators

Incubators let you hatch monster eggs into powerful allies. Place an egg from your inventory into an empty slot to start the process. Each egg shows how many turns remain until hatching. At the start of every turn the counter decreases. When an egg reaches zero, the hatched superior is moved to the waiting list. Recruit them from there to add the new mercenary to your party.


### Loot

Recipe scrolls may drop from monsters or appear in dungeons. Picking one up automatically adds the recipe to your known list. Duplicate scrolls are ignored once learned.

### Monster Farming

You can now cultivate monsters for equipment. Bury a defeated foe on a farm tile to start growing loot. The monster slowly decomposes over a set number of turns. Using fertilizer items reduces this time or improves the drop quality. When the growth is complete, harvest the plot to receive equipment influenced by the planted monster.
